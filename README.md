# C Program: For Loop

## Description
This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates the usage of the `for` loop in C programming language. The program prompts the user to enter a number, then it prints the multiplication table of that number using a `for` loop.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can download and install GCC, which is a widely used C compiler.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/for-loop-c-program.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd for-loop-c-program
   ```

3. Compile the C program using a C compiler. For example, using GCC:
   ```
   gcc for_loop.c -o for_loop
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./for_loop
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a number and see its multiplication table.

## Example
```
Enter a number: 5
Multiplication table of 5:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```
